**Project name**: Talking Rubbish Podcast Summariser
**Purpose**: Takes a TTML transcript file available from the Apple Podcast App and outputs a summarised version of the key takeaways.
**Caveats**: Rubbish Talk is removed from the transcript to reduce the number of tokens passed to the prompt. The idea is not to summarise the full podcast, just to pull out some useful tips and tricks to share with a local neighbourhood recycling group.
